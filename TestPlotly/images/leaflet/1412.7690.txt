Abstract
In this paper, we introduce some known map projections from a model of the Earth to a flat sheet
of paper or map and derive the plotting equations for these projections. The first fundamental form
and the Gaussian fundamental quantities are defined and applied to obtain the plotting equations
and distortions in length, shape and size for some of these map projections.

The concepts, definitions and proofs in this work are chosen mostly from [5, 6].

Introduction

A map projection is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of positions on the surface
of the Earth to a flat sheet of paper, a map. More precisely, a map projection requires a transformation
from a set of two independent coordinates on the model of the Earth (the latitude φ and longitude λ) to a
set of two independent coordinates on the map (the Cartesian coordinates x and y), i.e., a transformation
matrix T such that

However, since we are dealing with partial derivative and fundamental quantities (to be defined later), it
is impossible to find such a transformation explicitly.
There are a number of techniques for map projection, yet in all of them distortion occurs in length,
angle, shape, area or in a combination of these. Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that a sphere’s surface
cannot be represented on a map without distortion (see [5]).
A terrestrial globe is a three dimensional scale model of the Earth that does not distort the real
shape and the real size of large futures of the Earth. The term globe is used for those objects that are
approximately spherical. The equation for spherical model of the Earth with radius R is

An oblate ellipsoid or spheroid is a quadratic surface obtained by rotating an ellipse about its minor
axis (the axis that passes through the north pole and the south pole). The shape of the Earth is appeared
to be an oblate ellipsoid (mean Earth ellipsoid), and the geodetic latitudes and longitudes of positions
on the surface of the Earth coming from satellite observations are on this ellipsoid. The equation for

where a is the semimajor axis, and b is the semiminor axis of the spheroid of revolution.
The spherical representation of the Earth (terrestrial globe) must be modified to maintain accurate
representation of either shape or size of the spheroidal representation of the Earth. We discuss about
these two representations in Section 4.
There are three major types of map projections:
1. Equal-area projections. These projections preserve the area (the size) between the map and
the model of the Earth. In other words, every section of the map keeps a constant ratio to the area of the
Earth which it represents. Some of these projections are Albers with one or two standard parallels (the
conical equal-area), the Bonne, the azimuthal and Lambert cylindrical equal-area which are best applied
to a local area of the Earth, and some of them are world maps such as the sinusoidal, the Mollweide, the
parabolic, the Hammer-Aitoff, the Boggs eumorphic, and Eckert IV.
2. Conformal projections. These projections maintain the shape of an area during transformation
from the Earth to a map. These projections include the Mercator, the Lambert conformal with one
standard parallel, and the stereographic. These projections are only applicable to limited areas on the
model of the Earth for any one map. Since there is no practical use for conformal world maps, conformal
world maps are not considered.
3. Conventional projections. These projections are neither equal-area nor conformal, and they
are designed based on some particular applications. Some examples are the simple conic, the gnomonic,
the azimuthal equidistant, the Miller, the polyconic, the Robinson, and the plate carree projections.
In this paper, we only show the derivation of plotting equations on a map for the Mercator and
Lambert cylindrical equal-area for a spherical model of the Earth (Section 2), the Albers with one
standard parallel and the azimuthal for a spherical model of the Earth and the Lambert conformal with
one standard parallel for a spheroidal model of the Earth (Section 5), the sinusoidal (Section 6), the
simple conic and the plate carree projections (Section 7). The methods to obtain other projections are
similar to these projections, and the reader is referred to [2, 5, 6].
Suppose that a terrestrial glob is covered with infinitesimal circles. In order to show distortions in a
map projection, one may look at the projection of these circles in a map which are ellipses whose axes are
the two principal directions along which scale is maximal and minimal at that point on the map. This
mathematical contrivance is called Tissot’s indicatrix.
Usually Tissot’s indicatrices are placed across a map along the intersections of meridians and parallels
to the equator, and they provide a good tool to calculate the magnitude of distortions at those points
(the intersections).
In an equal-area projection, Tissot’s indicatrices change shape (from circles to ellipses), whereas their
areas remain the same. In conformal projection, however, the shape of circles preserves, and the area
varies. In conventional projection, both shape and size of these circles change. In this paper, we portrayed
the Mercator, the Lambert cylindrical equal-area, the sinusoidal and the plate carree maps with Tissot’s
indicatrices.
In Section 8, the equations for distortions of length, area and angle are derived, and distortion in length
for the Albers projection and in length and area for the Mercator projection are calculated, [5, 6, 9].

Mercator projection and Lambert cylindrical projection

In this section, by an elementary method, we show the cylindrical method that Mercator used to map
from a spherical model of the Earth to a flat sheet of paper. Also, we give the plotting equations for
the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection. Then, in Section 3, we obtain the Gaussian fundamental
quantities, and show a routine mathematical way to find plotting equations for different map projections.
This section is based mostly on [4].
Let S be the globe, and C be a circular cylinder tangent to S along the equator, see Fig. 1. Projecting
S along the rays passing through the center of S onto C, and unrolling the cylinder onto a vertical strip
in a plane is called central cylindrical projection. Clearly, each meridian on the sphere is mapped to a
vertical line to the equator, and each parallel of the equator is mapped onto a circle on the cylinder and
so a line parallel to the equator on the map. All methods discussed in this section and other sections are

Figure 1: Geometry for the cylindrical projection
about central projection, i.e., rays pass through the center of the Earth to a cone or cylinder. Methods
for those projections that are not central are similar to central projections (see [5, 6]).
Let w be the width of the map. The scale of the map along the equator is s = w/(2πR) that is the
ratio of size of objects drawn in the map to actual size of the object it represents. The scale of the map
usually is shown by three methods: arithmetical (e.g. 1:6,000,000), verbal (e.g. 100 miles to the inch) or
geometrical.
At latitude φ, the parallel to the equator is a circle with circumference 2πR cos φ, so the scale of the
map at this latitude is
sh =

w
= s sec φ,
2πR cos φ

(3)

where the subscript h stands for horizontal.
Assume that φ and λ are in radians, and the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system corresponds
to the intersection of the Greenwich meridian (λ = 0) and the equator (φ = 0). Then every cylindrical
3

projection is given explicitly by the following equations
x=

wλ
,
2π

y = f (φ).

(4)

For instance, it can be seen from Fig. 1 that a central cylindrical projection is given by
x=

wλ
,
2π

y = r tan φ,

where for a map of width w, a globe of radius r = w/(2π) is chosen.
In a globe, the arc length between latitudes of φ and φ1 (in radians) along a meridian is
2πR ·

φ1 − φ
= R(φ1 − φ),
2π

and the image on the map has the length f (φ1 ) − f (φ). So the overall scale factor of this arc along the
meridian when φ1 gets closer and closer to φ is
sv =

1
f (φ1 ) − f (φ)
1 0
f (φ) =
lim
,
R
R φ1 →φ
φ1 − φ

(5)

where the subscript v stands for vertical.
The goal of Mercator was to equate the horizontal scale with vertical scale at latitude φ, i.e., sh = sv .
Thus, from Eqs. (3) and (5),
f 0 (φ) =

w
sec φ.
2π

(6)

Mercator was not be able to solve Equation 6 precisely because logarithms were not invented! But now,
we know that the following is the solution to Eq. (6) (use f (0) = 0 to make the constant coming out
from the integration equal to zero),
y = f (φ) =

w
ln | sec φ + tan φ|.
2π

(7)

Thus, the equations for the Mercator conformal projection (central cylindrical conformal mapping) are
x=

wλ
,
2π

y=

w
ln | sec φ + tan φ|.
2π

Fig. 2 shows the Mercator projection with Tissot’s indicatrices that do not change their shape (all of
them are circles indicating a conformal projection) while their size get larger and larger toward the poles.
Now if the goal is preserving size rather than shape, then we would make the horizontal and vertical
scaling reciprocal, so the stretching in one direction will match shrinking in the other. Thus, from Eqs.
(3) and (5), we obtain f 0 (φ) sec φ = c or
f 0 (φ) = c cos φ,

(8)

where c is a constant. From Eqs. (6) and (8), we can choose c in such away that for a given latitude, the
map also preserves the shape in that area. For instance if φ = 0, then we choose c = w/(2π), and so the
map near equator is conformal too. Hence, the equations for the cylindrical equal-area projection (one
of Lambert’s maps) are
wλ

y=

Fig. 3 shows the Lambert projection with Tissot’s indicatrices that do not change their size (indicating
an equal-area projection) while their shape are changing toward the poles.

First fundamental form

In this section, we derive the first fundamental form for a general surface that completely describes the
metric properties of the surface, and it is a key in map projection, [3, 5, 6, 9].

Since we are dealing with latitudes and longitudes on a spherical or spheroidal model of the Earth,
→

−
the vectors →
a and b are orthogonal (meridians are normal to equator parallels). Also, in maps, we are
dealing with the polar and Cartesian coordinate systems in which their axes are perpendicular. Thus,
from Eq. (12), because cos 90◦ = 0, one obtains F = 0.
Therefore, the first fundamental form (11) in map projection will be deduced to the following form:
(ds)2 = E(dα)2 + G(dβ)2 .

(14)

Example 1 The first fundamental form for a planar surface
1. in the Cartesian coordinate system (a cylindrical surface) is (ds)2 = (dx)2 +(dy)2 , where E = G = 1,
2. in the polar coordinate system (a conical surface) is (ds)2 = (dr)2 + r2 (dθ)2 , where E = 1 and
G = r2 ,
3. in the spherical model of the Earth, Eq. (1), is (ds)2 = R2 (dφ)2 + R2 cos2 φ(dλ)2 , where E = R2
and G = R2 cos2 φ, and
4. in the spheroidal model of the Earth, Eq. (2), is (ds)2 = M 2 (dφ)2 + N 2 cos2 φ(dλ)2 , where E = M 2
and G = N 2 cos2 φ in which M is the radius of curvature in meridian and N is the radius of curvature in
prime vertical which are both functions of φ:

Now suppose that φ and λ are the parameters of the model of the Earth with the fundamental
quantities e, f and g.
Consider a two-dimensional projection with parametric curves defined by the parameters u and v.
For instance, for the polar or conical coordinates, we have u = r and v = θ. Let E 0 , F 0 and G0 be its
fundamental quantities.
Also, assume that on the plotting surface a second set of parameters, x and y, with the fundamental
quantities E, F and G.
The relationship between the two sets of parameters on the plane is given by
x = x(u, v),

y = y(u, v).

(15)

As an example, x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ for the polar and Cartesian coordinates.
The relationship between the parametric curves φ, λ, u and v is
u = u(φ, λ),

v = v(φ, λ).

(16)

Eq. (16) must be unique and reversible, i.e., a point on the Earth must represent only one point on
the map and vice versa. From Eqs. (15) and (16), we have

x = x u(φ, λ), v(φ, λ) ,
y = y u(φ, λ), v(φ, λ) .

Projection from an ellipsoid to a sphere

In this section, we describe how much the latitudes and longitudes of a spheroidal model of the Earth
will be effected once they are transformed to a spherical model, i.e., how much distortion in shape and
size happens when one projects a spheroidal model of the Earth to a spherical model, [2, 5, 6, 8]. We
distinguish two cases, equal-area transformation and conformal transformation.
Case 1. A spherical model of the Earth that has the same surface area as that of the reference ellipsoid
is called the authalic sphere. This sphere may be used as an intermediate step in the transformation from
the ellipsoid to the mapping surface.
8

Let RA , φA and λA be the authalic radius, latitude and longitude, respectively. Also, let φ and λ
be the geodetic latitude and longitude, respectively. From Example 1, we have e = M 2 , g = N 2 cos2 φ,
2

E 0 = RA

In the transformation from the ellipsoid to the authalic sphere, longitude is invariant, i.e., λ = λA .
Moreover, φA is independent of λA and so λ. Thus Eq. (24) reduces to

(29)

Since the eccentricity eab is a small number, the above series are convergent. The relation between
authalic and geodetic latitudes is equal at latitudes 0◦ and 90◦ , and the difference between them at other
latitudes is about 0◦ .1 for the WGS-84 spheroid (see [5] for the definitions of the WGS-84 and WGS-72
spheroids).
Example 2

sphere is

from Eq. (29), for geodetic latitude φ = 45◦ , we have sin φA ≈ 0.70552 which gives φA ≈ 44◦ .8713.

Case 2. A conformal sphere is an sphere defined for conformal transformation from an ellipsoid,
and similar to the authalic sphere may be used as an intermediate step in the transformation from the
reference ellipsoid to a mapping surface.
Let Rc , φc and λc be the conformal radius, latitude and longitude for the conformal sphere, respectively. Let e and g be the same fundamental quantities as Case 1, and E 0 = Rc2 and G0 = Rc2 cos2 φc .
Also, let φc = φc (φ) and λc = λ. Thus, from Eq. (20),

Albers and Lambert, one standard parallel

In this section, we describe the Albers one standard parallel (equal-area conic projection) and Lambert
one standard parallel (conformal conic projection) at latitude φ0 which give good maps around that
latitude (cf., [1, 5, 6, 8]).
We start with some geometric properties in a cone tangent to a spherical model of the Earth at
latitude φ0 . In Fig. 6, ACN and BDN are two meridians separated by a longitude difference of ∆λ, and
CD is an arc of the circle parallel to the equator. We have CD = DO0 ∆λ and DN 0 sin φ0 = DO0 and
approximately θ · DN 0 = CD.
Therefore, the first polar coordinate, θ, is a linear function of λ, i.e.,
θ = ∆λ sin φ0 .

(32)

The second polar coordinate, r, is a function of φ, i.e.,
r = r(φ).

(33)

The constant of the cone, denoted %, is defined from the relation between lengths on the developed cone
on the Earth. Let the total angle on the cone, θT , corresponding to 2π on the Earth be θT = d/r0 , where
d = 2πR cos φ0 is the circumference of the parallel circle to the equator at latitude φ0 , and r0 = R cot φ0 .
Thus θT = 2π sin φ0 , and the constant of the cone is defined as % = sin φ0 .
Case 1. The Albers projection. Consider a spherical model of the Earth. From Example 1, we know
that the first fundamental quantities for the sphere are e = R2 and g = R2 cos2 φ and for a cone (the

10

Solving Eq. (35) by knowing the fact that an increase in φ corresponds to a decrease in r, one gets
r2 =

−2R2 sin φ
+ c.
sin φ0

(36)

Imposing the boundary condition r0 = R cot φ0 into Eq. (36), c = 2R2 + R2 cot2 φ0 , and so after some
simplifications, Eq. (36) becomes

The Cartesian plotting equations for a conical projection are defined as follows:
x = sr sin θ,

y = s(r0 − r cos θ),

11

(38)

where s is the scale factor, θ and r are given respectively by Eqs. (32) and (37), and r0 = R cot φ0 . The
origin of the projection has the coordinates λ0 (the longitude of central meridian) and φ0 . Fig. 7 shows
the Albers projection with one standard parallel.
If we let φ0 = 90◦ , then Eqs. (32) and (37) reduce to
p
θ = ∆λ,
r = R 2(1 − sin φ),
that are the polar coordinates for the azimuthal equal-area projection, a special case of the Albers
projection, see Fig. 8.

Case 2. The Lambert projection. In this case, we consider a spheroidal model of the Earth. From
Example 1, the fundamental quantities for this model are e = M 2 and g = N 2 cos2 φ, and the fundamental
quantities for a cone are E 0 = 1 and G0 = r2 . Again using Eqs. (32) and (33), Eq. (20) becomes

Substituting these values in Eq. (23), integrating, simplifying and noting that r increases as φ decreases,
one gets

Sinusoidal projection

In this section, we only discuss about the sinusoidal equal-area projection that is a projection of the entire
model of the Earth onto a single map, and it gives an adequate whole world coverage, [2, 5].
Consider a spherical model of the Earth with the fundamental quantities e = R2 and g = R2 cos2 φ.
The first fundamental quantities on a planar mapping surface is E 0 = G0 = 1. Substituting these
fundamental quantities into Eq. (22) (using Eq. (21)), one gets

Taking the positive square root of Eq. (41) and using the fact that λ and φ are independent, one obtains
dx = R cos φdλ, and so by integrating x = λR cos φ + c. Using the boundary condition x = 0 when
λ = λ0 , one gets c = −λ0 R cos φ, and so the plotting equations for the sinusoidal projection become as
follow (φ and λ in radians):
x = sR∆λ cos φ,

y = sRφ,

(42)

where s is the scale factor. Fig. 10 shows a normalized plot for the sinusoidal projection. In this map,
the meridians are sinusoidal curves except the central meridian which is a vertical line and they all meet
each other in the poles. This is why this map is known as the sinusoidal map. The x axis is also along
the equator.
The inverse transformation from the Cartesian to geographic coordinates is simply calculated from
Eq. (42):

Some conventional projections

In this section, we give the plotting equations for two conventional projections, the simple conic projection
(one standard parallel) and the plate carree projection (cf., [2, 5, 7]). As we mentioned earlier, these
projections neither preserve the shape nor do they preserve the size, and they are usually used for simple
portrayals of the world or regions with minimal geographic data such as index maps.
1. The simple conic projection is a projection that the distances along every meridian are true scale.
Suppose that the conic is tangent to the spherical model of the Earth at latitude φ0 , see Fig. 11. In
this figure, we have r0 = R cot φ0 . We want to have DE = DE 0 , but DE 0 = R(φ − φ0 ). Thus the polar
coordinates for this projection are
r = r0 − R(φ − φ0 ),

θ = ∆λ sin φ0 .

Replacing these values into Eq. (38) gives its Cartesian coordinates.

2. The plate carree, the equirectangular projection, is a conventional cylindrical projection that
divides the meridians equally the same way as on the sphere. Also, it divides the equator and its parallels
equally. The plate carree plotting equations are very simple:
x = sR∆λ,

y = sRφ,

where φ and λ are in radians. Fig. 12 shows the plate carree map with Tissot’s indicatrices which are
changing their shape and size when moving toward the poles indicating that this map is neither equal-area
nor conformal.

Theory of distortion

In this section, we discuss about three types of distortions from differential geometry approach: distortions
in length, area and angle, and we present them in term of the Gaussian fundamental quantities (cf.,
[5, 6, 9]).
1. The distortion in length is defined as the ratio of a length of a line on a map to the length of the
true line on a model of the Earth. More precisely,
KL2 =

(ds)2M
E(dφ)2 + G(dλ)2
=
.
(ds)2E
e(dφ)2 + g(dλ)2
r

From Eq. (43), the distortion along the meridians (dλ = 0) is Km =
r
G
.
the equator (dφ = 0) is Ke =
g

(43)
E
, and along the lines parallel to
e

2. The distortion in area is defined as the ratio of an area on a map
√ to the true area on a model of
the Earth. From Eq. (13) (f = F = 0), the area on the map is AM = EG, and the corresponding area
√
on the model of the Earth is AE = eg. Thus, the distortion in area is
s
AM
EG
KA =
=
= Km Ke .
(44)
AE

15

In equal-area map projections, from Eq. (21), KA = Km Ke = 1.
3. The distortion in angle is defined as (in percentage):
Kα = 100 ·

α−β
,
α

(45)

where α is the angle on a model of the Earth (the azimuth), and β is the projected angle on a map (the
azimuth α on the map, cf., Fig. 13).

Figure 13: Geometry for differential parallelograms
In order to obtain β as a function of the fundamental quantities and α, we first calculate sin(β ± α).
From Fig. 13, we have
sin(β ± α) = sin β cos α ± cos β sin α

Hence,
sin(β − α) =

Ke − Km
sin(β + α).
Ke + Km

Define
f (β) = sin(β − α) −

Ke − Km
sin(β + α).
Ke + Km

Now the goal is to find the roots of f . This can be done by Newton’s iteration as follows:
βn+1 = βn −

16

f (βn )
,
f 0 (βn )

where

Ke − Km
cos(βn + α).
Ke + Km
The iteration is rapidly convergent by letting β0 = α. In conformal mapping, from Eq. (23), Ke = Km ,
and so the function f will have a unique solution (β = α).
f 0 (βn ) = cos(βn − α) −

Example 3 In this example, we show the distortions in length in the Albers projection with one standard
parallel. From Example 1, the first fundamental form for the map is
(ds)2M = (dr)2 + r2 (dθ)2 = E 0 (dr)2 + G0 (dθ)2 ,

(46)

and the first fundamental form for the spherical model of the Earth is
(ds)2E = R2 (dφ)2 + R2 cos2 φ(dλ)2 = e(dφ)2 + g(dλ)2 .

(47)

Taking the derivatives of Eqs. (32) and (35), one obtains
dθ = sin φ0 dλ,

dr = p

−R cos φ dφ
1 + sin2 φ0 − 2 sin φ sin φ0

,

respectively. Substitute the above equations into Eq. (46) to get
(ds)2M =

R2 cos2 φ
(dφ)2 + r2 sin2 φ0 (dλ)2 = E(dφ)2 + G(dλ)2 .
1 + sin2 φ0 − 2 sin φ sin φ0

(48)

Substituting (47) and (48) in Eq. (43) gives the total length distortion. Also,

which are functions of φ. Clearly, Km Ke = 1.
Example 4 In this example, we first use the first fundamental form to obtain the plotting equations
for the Mercator projection, and then we show its length and area distortion. From Example 1, the first
fundamental form for the cylindrical surface (the Cartesian coordinate system) is
(ds)2M = (dy)2 + (dx)2 .

(49)

Taking the derivative of Eq. (4) and substituting in Eq. (49), one finds
 dy 2
(dφ)2 + s2 R2 (dλ)2 = E(dφ)2 + G(dλ)2 ,
(50)
(ds)2M =
dφ
2
where s is the scale of the map along the equator, E = dy/dφ and G = s2 R2 . The first fundamental
quantities for the spherical model of the Earth are e = R2 and g = R2 cos2 φ. Substituting these
fundamental quantities in Eq. (23) and simplifying, one obtains
sRdφ
.
cos φ

dy =

(51)

It is easy to see that integrating the above differential equation and applying the boundary condition
2
y(0) = 0, Eq. (7) follows. By Eq. (51), E = dy/dφ = s2 R2 / cos2 φ. Therefore, substituting Eqs. (47)
and (50) in Eq. (43), the length distortion will be
KL =

s
.
cos φ

17

It can be seen that KL = Km = Ke , and so from Eq. (44), the distortion in area for the Mercator
projection is
s2
KA = Km Ke =
.
cos2 φ
Hence, in the Mercator projection both length and area distortions are functions of φ not λ.

Conclusion

There are a number of map projections used for different purposes, and we discussed about three major
classes of them, equal-area, conformal, and conventional. Users may also create their own map based on
their projects by starting with a base map of known projection and scale.
In this paper, in cylindrical projections, we assume that the cylinder is tangent to the equator. Making
the cylinder tangent to other closed curves on the Earth results good maps in areas close to the tangency.
This is also applied for conical and azimuthal projections.
In all projections from a 3-D surface to a 2-D surface, there are distortions in length, shape or size that
some of them can be removed (not all) or minimized from the map based on some specific applications.
We also noticed in Section 4 that projecting a spheroidal model of the Earth to a spherical model of the
Earth will also distort length, shape and angle.
Intelligent map users should have knowledge about the theory of distortion in order to compare and
distinguish their maps with the true surface on the Earth that they are studying.
