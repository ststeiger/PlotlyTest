                                      Abstract
              In this paper, we introduce some known map projections from a model of the Earth to a ﬂat sheet
              of paper or map and derive the plotting equations for these projections. The ﬁrst fundamental form
              and the Gaussian fundamental quantities are deﬁned and applied to obtain the plotting equations
              and distortions in length, shape and size for some of these map projections.
            The concepts, deﬁnitions and proofs in this work are chosen mostly from [5, 6].
          1   Introduction
          Amapprojectionisasystematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of positions on the surface
          of the Earth to a ﬂat sheet of paper, a map. More precisely, a map projection requires a transformation
          from a set of two independent coordinates on the model of the Earth (the latitude φ and longitude λ) to a
          set of two independent coordinates on the map (the Cartesian coordinates x and y), i.e., a transformation
          matrix T such that              
                                     x  =T φ .
                                     y      λ
          However, since we are dealing with partial derivative and fundamental quantities (to be deﬁned later), it
          is impossible to ﬁnd such a transformation explicitly.
            There are a number of techniques for map projection, yet in all of them distortion occurs in length,
          angle, shape, area or in a combination of these. Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that a sphere’s surface
          cannot be represented on a map without distortion (see [5]).
            A terrestrial globe is a three dimensional scale model of the Earth that does not distort the real
     arXiv:1412.7690v1  [physics.geo-ph]  16 Dec 2014shape and the real size of large futures of the Earth. The term globe is used for those objects that are
          approximately spherical. The equation for spherical model of the Earth with radius R is
                                   x2  y2  z2
                                   R2 + R2 + R2 = 1.                  (1)
            An oblate ellipsoid or spheroid is a quadratic surface obtained by rotating an ellipse about its minor
          axis (the axis that passes through the north pole and the south pole). The shape of the Earth is appeared
          to be an oblate ellipsoid (mean Earth ellipsoid), and the geodetic latitudes and longitudes of positions
          on the surface of the Earth coming from satellite observations are on this ellipsoid. The equation for
                                         1
              spheroidal model of the Earth is

                                                  x +y +z =1,                                      (2)

              where a is the semimajor axis, and b is the semiminor axis of the spheroid of revolution.
                 The spherical representation of the Earth (terrestrial globe) must be modiﬁed to maintain accurate
              representation of either shape or size of the spheroidal representation of the Earth. We discuss about
              these two representations in Section 4.
                 There are three major types of map projections:
                 1. Equal-area projections. These projections preserve the area (the size) between the map and
              the model of the Earth. In other words, every section of the map keeps a constant ratio to the area of the
              Earth which it represents. Some of these projections are Albers with one or two standard parallels (the
              conical equal-area), the Bonne, the azimuthal and Lambert cylindrical equal-area which are best applied
              to a local area of the Earth, and some of them are world maps such as the sinusoidal, the Mollweide, the
              parabolic, the Hammer-Aitoﬀ, the Boggs eumorphic, and Eckert IV.
                 2. Conformal projections. These projections maintain the shape of an area during transformation
              from the Earth to a map. These projections include the Mercator, the Lambert conformal with one
              standard parallel, and the stereographic. These projections are only applicable to limited areas on the
              model of the Earth for any one map. Since there is no practical use for conformal world maps, conformal
              world maps are not considered.
                 3. Conventional projections. These projections are neither equal-area nor conformal, and they
              are designed based on some particular applications. Some examples are the simple conic, the gnomonic,
              the azimuthal equidistant, the Miller, the polyconic, the Robinson, and the plate carree projections.
                 In this paper, we only show the derivation of plotting equations on a map for the Mercator and
              Lambert cylindrical equal-area for a spherical model of the Earth (Section 2), the Albers with one
              standard parallel and the azimuthal for a spherical model of the Earth and the Lambert conformal with
              one standard parallel for a spheroidal model of the Earth (Section 5), the sinusoidal (Section 6), the
              simple conic and the plate carree projections (Section 7). The methods to obtain other projections are
              similar to these projections, and the reader is referred to [2, 5, 6].
                 Suppose that a terrestrial glob is covered with inﬁnitesimal circles. In order to show distortions in a
              mapprojection, one may look at the projection of these circles in a map which are ellipses whose axes are
              the two principal directions along which scale is maximal and minimal at that point on the map. This
              mathematical contrivance is called Tissot’s indicatrix.
                 Usually Tissot’s indicatrices are placed across a map along the intersections of meridians and parallels
              to the equator, and they provide a good tool to calculate the magnitude of distortions at those points
              (the intersections).
                 In an equal-area projection, Tissot’s indicatrices change shape (from circles to ellipses), whereas their
              areas remain the same. In conformal projection, however, the shape of circles preserves, and the area
              varies. In conventional projection, both shape and size of these circles change. In this paper, we portrayed
              the Mercator, the Lambert cylindrical equal-area, the sinusoidal and the plate carree maps with Tissot’s
              indicatrices.
                 In Section 8, the equations for distortions of length, area and angle are derived, and distortion in length
              for the Albers projection and in length and area for the Mercator projection are calculated, [5, 6, 9].

             2   Mercator projection and Lambert cylindrical projection
             In this section, by an elementary method, we show the cylindrical method that Mercator used to map
             from a spherical model of the Earth to a ﬂat sheet of paper. Also, we give the plotting equations for
             the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection. Then, in Section 3, we obtain the Gaussian fundamental
             quantities, and show a routine mathematical way to ﬁnd plotting equations for diﬀerent map projections.
             This section is based mostly on [4].
                Let S be the globe, and C be a circular cylinder tangent to S along the equator, see Fig. 1. Projecting
             S along the rays passing through the center of S onto C, and unrolling the cylinder onto a vertical strip
             in a plane is called central cylindrical projection. Clearly, each meridian on the sphere is mapped to a
             vertical line to the equator, and each parallel of the equator is mapped onto a circle on the cylinder and
             so a line parallel to the equator on the map. All methods discussed in this section and other sections are
                                  Figure 1:Geometry for the cylindrical projection
             about central projection, i.e., rays pass through the center of the Earth to a cone or cylinder. Methods
             for those projections that are not central are similar to central projections (see [5, 6]).
                Let w be the width of the map. The scale of the map along the equator is s = w/(2πR) that is the
             ratio of size of objects drawn in the map to actual size of the object it represents. The scale of the map
             usually is shown by three methods: arithmetical (e.g. 1:6,000,000), verbal (e.g. 100 miles to the inch) or
             geometrical.
                At latitude φ, the parallel to the equator is a circle with circumference 2πRcosφ, so the scale of the
             map at this latitude is
                                            s =    w    =ssecφ,                            (3)
                                            h   2πRcosφ
             where the subscript h stands for horizontal.
                Assume that φ and λ are in radians, and the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system corresponds
             to the intersection of the Greenwich meridian (λ = 0) and the equator (φ = 0). Then every cylindrical
                                                     3
                   projection is given explicitly by the following equations
                                                                x=wλ,         y = f(φ).                                           (4)
                                                                     2π
                   For instance, it can be seen from Fig. 1 that a central cylindrical projection is given by
                                                               x=wλ,         y = rtanφ,
                                                                    2π
                   where for a map of width w, a globe of radius r = w/(2π) is chosen.
                       In a globe, the arc length between latitudes of φ and φ (in radians) along a meridian is
                                                                                   1
                                                                    φ −φ
                                                             2πR· 1         =R(φ −φ),
                                                                      2π            1
                   and the image on the map has the length f(φ )−f(φ). So the overall scale factor of this arc along the
                                                                      1
                   meridian when φ1 gets closer and closer to φ is
                                                       s = 1f′(φ) = 1 lim f(φ1)−f(φ),                                             (5)
                                                         v   R           Rφ →φ       φ −φ
                                                                             1         1
                   where the subscript v stands for vertical.
                       The goal of Mercator was to equate the horizontal scale with vertical scale at latitude φ, i.e., s = s .
                                                                                                                              h     v
                   Thus, from Eqs. (3) and (5),
                                                                   f′(φ) = w secφ.                                                (6)
                                                                            2π
                   Mercator was not be able to solve Equation 6 precisely because logarithms were not invented! But now,
                   we know that the following is the solution to Eq. (6) (use f(0) = 0 to make the constant coming out
                   from the integration equal to zero),
                                                          y = f(φ) = w ln|secφ+tanφ|.                                             (7)
                                                                        2π
                   Thus, the equations for the Mercator conformal projection (central cylindrical conformal mapping) are
                                                       x=wλ,          y = w ln|secφ+tanφ|.
                                                             2π            2π
                   Fig. 2 shows the Mercator projection with Tissot’s indicatrices that do not change their shape (all of
                   them are circles indicating a conformal projection) while their size get larger and larger toward the poles.
                       Now if the goal is preserving size rather than shape, then we would make the horizontal and vertical
                   scaling reciprocal, so the stretching in one direction will match shrinking in the other. Thus, from Eqs.
                   (3) and (5), we obtain f′(φ)secφ = c or
                                                                    f′(φ) = ccosφ,                                                (8)
                   where c is a constant. From Eqs. (6) and (8), we can choose c in such away that for a given latitude, the
                   map also preserves the shape in that area. For instance if φ = 0, then we choose c = w/(2π), and so the
                   map near equator is conformal too. Hence, the equations for the cylindrical equal-area projection (one
                   of Lambert’s maps) are
                                                              x=wλ,         y = w sinφ.
                                                                   2π            2π
                   Fig. 3 shows the Lambert projection with Tissot’s indicatrices that do not change their size (indicating
                   an equal-area projection) while their shape are changing toward the poles.

          3  First fundamental form
          In this section, we derive the ﬁrst fundamental form for a general surface that completely describes the
          metric properties of the surface, and it is a key in map projection, [3, 5, 6, 9].

            The vector at any point P on the surface is given by r = r (α,β). If either of parameters α or β is
          held constant and the other one is varied, a space curve results, see Fig. 4.

            The tangent vectors to α-curve and β-curve at point P are respectively as follows:

                       Since we are dealing with latitudes and longitudes on a spherical or spheroidal model of the Earth,

                   the vectors a and b are orthogonal (meridians are normal to equator parallels). Also, in maps, we are
                   dealing with the polar and Cartesian coordinate systems in which their axes are perpendicular. Thus,
                   from Eq. (12), because cos90◦ = 0, one obtains F = 0.
                       Therefore, the ﬁrst fundamental form (11) in map projection will be deduced to the following form:
                                                                    2          2          2

              For instance, for the polar or conical coordinates, we have u = r and v = θ. Let E , F and G be its
              fundamental quantities.
                 Also, assume that on the plotting surface a second set of parameters, x and y, with the fundamental
              quantities E, F and G.
                 The relationship between the two sets of parameters on the plane is given by
                                             x=x(u,v),       y = y(u,v).                          (15)
              As an example, x = rcosθ and y = rsinθ for the polar and Cartesian coordinates.
                 The relationship between the parametric curves φ, λ, u and v is
                                             u=u(φ,λ),       v = v(φ,λ).                          (16)
                 Eq. (16) must be unique and reversible, i.e., a point on the Earth must represent only one point on
              the map and vice versa. From Eqs. (15) and (16), we have

              As we mentioned earlier, since we are dealing with orthogonal curves, f = F = F′ = 0. Using this fact
              and Eqs. (17), (18) and (19), the following relation can be derived (see Section X Chapter 2 in [5]):

              From Eq. (13), a mapping from the Earth to the plotting surface requires that

              In this section, we describe how much the latitudes and longitudes of a spheroidal model of the Earth
              will be eﬀected once they are transformed to a spherical model, i.e., how much distortion in shape and
              size happens when one projects a spheroidal model of the Earth to a spherical model, [2, 5, 6, 8]. We
              distinguish two cases, equal-area transformation and conformal transformation.
                 Case1. AsphericalmodeloftheEarththathasthesamesurfaceareaasthatofthereferenceellipsoid
              is called the authalic sphere. This sphere may be used as an intermediate step in the transformation from
              the ellipsoid to the mapping surface.

                 Let RA, φA and λA be the authalic radius, latitude and longitude, respectively. Also, let φ and λ
              be the geodetic latitude and longitude, respectively. From Example 1, we have e = M2, g = N2cos2φ,

              In the transformation from the ellipsoid to the authalic sphere, longitude is invariant, i.e., λ = λ .

              Rc =√MN for a given latitude φ which in this case φ = π/2. We refer to Chapter 5 Section 3 in [5] for
              the derivation.
              5    Albers and Lambert, one standard parallel
              In this section, we describe the Albers one standard parallel (equal-area conic projection) and Lambert
              one standard parallel (conformal conic projection) at latitude φ0 which give good maps around that
              latitude (cf., [1, 5, 6, 8]).
                 We start with some geometric properties in a cone tangent to a spherical model of the Earth at
              latitude φ . In Fig. 6, ACN and BDN are two meridians separated by a longitude diﬀerence of ∆λ, and
                      0
              CDis an arc of the circle parallel to the equator. We have CD = DO′∆λ and DN′sinφ0 = DO′ and
              approximately θ ·DN′ = CD.
              Therefore, the ﬁrst polar coordinate, θ, is a linear function of λ, i.e.,
                                                    θ = ∆λsinφ0.                                  (32)
              The second polar coordinate, r, is a function of φ, i.e.,
                                                      r = r(φ).                                   (33)
              The constant of the cone, denoted ̺, is deﬁned from the relation between lengths on the developed cone
              on the Earth. Let the total angle on the cone, θ , corresponding to 2π on the Earth be θ=d/r , where
                                                      T                                 T     0
              d = 2πRcosφ is the circumference of the parallel circle to the equator at latitude φ , and r = Rcotφ .
                          0                                                         0     0         0
              Thus θ =2πsinφ , and the constant of the cone is deﬁned as ̺ = sinφ .

              model of the Earth onto a single map, and it gives an adequate whole world coverage, [2, 5].

              Taking the positive square root of Eq. (41) and using the fact that λ and φ are independent, one obtains
              dx = Rcosφdλ, and so by integrating x = λRcosφ + c. Using the boundary condition x = 0 when
              λ = λ , one gets c = −λ Rcosφ, and so the plotting equations for the sinusoidal projection become as
                   0               0

              where s is the scale factor. Fig. 10 shows a normalized plot for the sinusoidal projection. In this map,
              the meridians are sinusoidal curves except the central meridian which is a vertical line and they all meet
              each other in the poles. This is why this map is known as the sinusoidal map. The x axis is also along
              the equator.
                 The inverse transformation from the Cartesian to geographic coordinates is simply calculated from
              Eq. (42):
                                              φ= y ,    ∆λ=     x   .

              In this section, we give the plotting equations for two conventional projections, the simple conic projection
              (one standard parallel) and the plate carree projection (cf., [2, 5, 7]). As we mentioned earlier, these
              projections neither preserve the shape nor do they preserve the size, and they are usually used for simple

                 1. The simple conic projection is a projection that the distances along every meridian are true scale.
              Suppose that the conic is tangent to the spherical model of the Earth at latitude φ0, see Fig. 11. In
              this ﬁgure, we have r = Rcotφ . We want to have DE = DE′, but DE′ = R(φ−φ ). Thus the polar

              coordinates for this projection are
                                         r = r0 −R(φ−φ0),    θ = ∆λsinφ0.
              Replacing these values into Eq. (38) gives its Cartesian coordinates.

                 2. The plate carree, the equirectangular projection, is a conventional cylindrical projection that
              divides the meridians equally the same way as on the sphere. Also, it divides the equator and its parallels
              equally. The plate carree plotting equations are very simple:
                                              x=sR∆λ,      y = sRφ,
              where φ and λ are in radians. Fig. 12 shows the plate carree map with Tissot’s indicatrices which are
              changing their shape and size when moving toward the poles indicating that this map is neither equal-area
              nor conformal.

              8    Theory of distortion
              In this section, we discuss about three types of distortions from diﬀerential geometry approach: distortions
              in length, area and angle, and we present them in term of the Gaussian fundamental quantities (cf.,
              [5, 6, 9]).
                 1. The distortion in length is deﬁned as the ratio of a length of a line on a map to the length of the
              true line on a model of the Earth. More precisely,
                                                   2         2       2
                                           K2 = (ds)M = E(dφ) +G(dλ) .                          (43)
                                            L       2        2       2
                                                (ds)     e(dφ) +g(dλ)
                                                    E
              From Eq. (43), the distortion along the meridians (dλ = 0) is K=rE,andalongthelines parallel to
                                                                  m      e
              the equator (dφ = 0) is Ke = rG.
                                         g
                 2. The distortion in area is deﬁned as the ratio of an area on a map to the true area on a model of
              the Earth. From Eq. (13) (f = F = 0), the area on the map is AM = √EG, and the corresponding area
                                           √
              on the model of the Earth is A= eg. Thus, the distortion in area is
                                       E
                                            K =AM =sEG=K K.                                     (44)
                                              A   A       eg     m e
                                                   E
                                                        15
              In equal-area map projections, from Eq. (21), K=K K =1.
                                                       A    m e
                 3. The distortion in angle is deﬁned as (in percentage):
                                                  K =100· α−β,                                    (45)
                                                    α        α
              where α is the angle on a model of the Earth (the azimuth), and β is the projected angle on a map (the
              azimuth α on the map, cf., Fig. 13).
                                    Figure 13:Geometry for diﬀerential parallelograms
                 In order to obtain β as a function of the fundamental quantities and α, we ﬁrst calculate sin(β ± α).
              From Fig. 13, we have
                                 sin(β ±α) = sinβcosα±cosβsinα

                                          =    G· dS    e· ds ±    E· dS    g · ds
                                                     dφ dλ√
                                          =(K ±K )          eg.
                                              e    m dSdS
              Hence,
                                                       K −K
                                           sin(β −α) =  e    msin(β +α).
                                                       K +K
                                                        e    m
              Deﬁne
                                                          K −K
                                        f(β) = sin(β −α)−  e    msin(β +α).
                                                          K +K
                                                           e    m
              Now the goal is to ﬁnd the roots of f. This can be done by Newton’s iteration as follows:
                                                            f(β )
                                                 β    =β −     n ,
                                                  n+1    n  f′(β )
                                                                n
                                                         16
              where
                                                          K −K
                                      f′(β ) = cos(β −α)−   e    mcos(β +α).
                                          n       n       K +K         n
                                                            e    m
              The iteration is rapidly convergent by letting β = α. In conformal mapping, from Eq. (23), K = K ,
                                                      0                                       e    m
              and so the function f will have a unique solution (β = α).

                                       (ds)2 = (dr)2 +r2(dθ)2 = E′(dr)2 +G′(dθ)2,                 (46)
                                          M
              and the ﬁrst fundamental form for the spherical model of the Earth is

              Taking the derivatives of Eqs. (32) and (35), one obtains
                                  dθ = sinφ0dλ,     dr = p     −Rcosφ dφ        ,
                                                           1+sin2φ −2sinφsinφ
                                                                   0           0
              respectively. Substitute the above equations into Eq. (46) to get
                                        R2cos2φ
                            2                             2   2  2      2        2       2

              Substituting (47) and (48) in Eq. (43) gives the total length distortion. Also,
                         r                                       s      p      2

              which are functions of φ. Clearly, K K = 1.

              Example 4 In this example, we ﬁrst use the ﬁrst fundamental form to obtain the plotting equations
              for the Mercator projection, and then we show its length and area distortion. From Example 1, the ﬁrst
              fundamental form for the cylindrical surface (the Cartesian coordinate system) is
                                                (ds)2 = (dy)2 +(dx)2.                             (49)
                                                   M
              Taking the derivative of Eq. (4) and substituting in Eq. (49), one ﬁnds

              where s is the scale of the map along the equator, E = dy/dφand G = s R . The ﬁrst fundamental
                                                                 2           2   2
              quantities for the spherical model of the Earth are e = Rand g = R cos φ. Substituting these
              fundamental quantities in Eq. (23) and simplifying, one obtains
                                                     dy = sRdφ.                                   (51)

              It is easy to see that integrating the above diﬀerential equation and applying the boundary condition

              y(0) = 0, Eq. (7) follows. By Eq. (51), E = dy/dφ=s R /cos φ. Therefore, substituting Eqs. (47)
              and (50) in Eq. (43), the length distortion will be
                                                    K = s .
                                                      L   cosφ
                                                         17
              It can be seen that K= K = K , and so from Eq. (44), the distortion in area for the Mercator
                                L     m    e
              projection is

                                              K =K K =          .
                                               A     m e   cos2φ
              Hence, in the Mercator projection both length and area distortions are functions of φ not λ.
              9   Conclusion
              There are a number of map projections used for diﬀerent purposes, and we discussed about three major
              classes of them, equal-area, conformal, and conventional. Users may also create their own map based on
              their projects by starting with a base map of known projection and scale.
                In this paper, in cylindrical projections, we assume that the cylinder is tangent to the equator. Making
              the cylinder tangent to other closed curves on the Earth results good maps in areas close to the tangency.
              This is also applied for conical and azimuthal projections.
                In all projections from a 3-D surface to a 2-D surface, there are distortions in length, shape or size that
              some of them can be removed (not all) or minimized from the map based on some speciﬁc applications.
              Wealso noticed in Section 4 that projecting a spheroidal model of the Earth to a spherical model of the
              Earth will also distort length, shape and angle.
                Intelligent map users should have knowledge about the theory of distortion in order to compare and
              distinguish their maps with the true surface on the Earth that they are studying.
