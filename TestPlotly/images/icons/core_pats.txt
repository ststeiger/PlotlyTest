Agreed. 
Microsoft doesn't love open-source. 
Microsoft loves headlines that make it appear they love open-source.
The reality is Microsoft's open-source efforts have always been completely underwhelming.

Remember these headlines: MS contributes 20000 lines of code, and MS is 17th largest kernel contributor?
Reality: The code was for Linux HyperV drivers that only Windows users will ever use. 
The multiple submission attempts to get those drivers up to acceptable Linux kernel standards 
pushed MS to 17th place. All for drivers that only benefit HyperV users.

How about MS announces the Mono project, an open-source, cross-platform, .Net compatible framework?
Reality: .Net apps made for Mono run on .Net just fine, however, .Net apps that include 3rd party extensions (i.e. almost all), 
don't run on Mono because the 3rd party extensions are only available for Windows. So it is a one way street.

Here's another: MS and Novell announce Moonlight, a cross-platform Silverlight compatible media streamer.
Reality: Moonlight was not allowed to include Silverlight's DRM, so Moonlight was pretty much useless.

And finally, Linux guests on Azure.
Reality: Microsoft only agreed to run Linux clients on Azure
 because Redhat insisted on it as part of the agreement to run Windows on Redhat clusters.

As to these recent announcements, I'll reserve judgment until I see the reality. I am not hopeful.



Most of the patents revolve around 8.3/long filenames on FAT filesystems.
Microsoft gets a new patent every time the File Allocation Table gets bigger. 
The only difference between FAT (FAT8), FAT16, and FAT32 is the table size, but each version gets a new patent, so it just goes on, and on.


How doubling the number of bytes of one number qualifies as a completely new, never done before idea, 
worthy of a new patent is beyond any normal person's comprehension. 
We would ask the people at the Patent Office, but they are apparently too busy counting Microsoft bucks to answer.

So register patents for FAT 64, FAT 128 and FAT 256 before Microsoft does and put them in the public domain.

They build on their predecessors so licensees will still need to licence the previous patents, but when the previous patents finish, then that's it.

I'm totally angry at the idiots who run the patent system. 
Actually, I'm angry at the morons who enacted it. The whole of it. 
And I'm even more angry at these misfits, looney tunes and squalid criminals that haven't abolished it yet.

MS is a noises ninja.
Gates said 15 years ago he was "betting the farm" on .NET. It failed, and monopoly farm is thriving. Ignore everything they say, it's just PR.

Which would be funny, if it wasn't so sad, considering Oracle:

1) Re-brands Redhat Enterprise Linux as Oracle Enterprise Linux, without compensating, or even crediting, Redhat.

2) Nearly killed both OpenOffice and MySQL after acquiring the open source projects.
